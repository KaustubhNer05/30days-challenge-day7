		<h2>About This App</h2>
		<p>
			This Country Flags Identifier Game was created by Kaustubh as part of the #30Days30Projects challenge.
		</p></br>
		<p>
			The goal was to build a fun, interactive quiz that helps users learn and identify country flags using real-time data from the RESTCountries API.
		</p></br>
		<p>
			Huge thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamal-shah-63371b20">Kamal Shah</a> Sir for his constant support and encouragement throughout this journey.
